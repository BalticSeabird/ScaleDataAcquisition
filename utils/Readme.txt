# Check results: 
# Correct match between event and raw data: 
- DGT2 2023  
- DGT1 2023
- DGT2 2024  
- DGT1 2024

# But Far3_scale 2024 looks weird, events and data doesn't seem to match!
# Far3_scale name is correct but event identifier does not work perfectly in 2024 data due to calibration error. 
# Maybe just skip generating videos for this one!


# Does name in original db + event_db match the actual video footage?
# Check one film from each camera each year (total: 16 films) to match between event time and video time
